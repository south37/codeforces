##
- at i, we want to know the "number of papers under j <= i".
  - because, maximum number means the h-index.

## e.g.1
- 5, 1, 2

- 1: 5
  - h-index: 1
- 2:
 - 5
 - 1
  - h-index: 1
- 2:
 - 5
 - 1
  - h-index: 1

## naive aproach
- count all pattern in each step.
  - if index is i, then all the count of papers under j where j in [0, i-1]
    - if j

## what we need?
- we want to know "the count under x"
  - its value changes when j is inserted.

##
- maximum value (increasing)
  -
